## 1. GETTING STARTED: THE HIERARCHY
BrandHub organizes data into **Brands** (Master Nodes) and **Products** (Sub-Nodes).
*   **The Dashboard:** Filter by "Companies" or "Products" using the top toggle.
*   **Favorites:** Use the Star icon on any card to pin it to your sidebar for rapid access.

## 2. THE 19 STUDIOS: HOW-TO GUIDE

### Identity Forge
*   **Objective:** Define the "Soul" of the brand.
*   **Input:** Mission Statement and Core Values.
*   **Pro Tip:** Use the "Intro Video" slot for a 15-second brand loop. If using YouTube, the system automatically mutes and loops it for a premium feel.

### Symbol Protocol (Multi-Variant)
*   **Input:** Link specific URLs for **Primary**, **Inverse (White)**, and **Monochrome (Black)** variants.
*   **Usage:** These variants are used for favicons, app icons, and social avatars where background contrast varies.
*   **Previewing:** In the brand view, use the color dots above each symbol to test how it looks against different surface levels.

### Palette Lab (Advanced Usage)
*   **Surface Testing:** Use the A/B test area to pair background and text colors. The system will tell you if your text is readable (AAA) or if it fails accessibility standards.
*   **Image Upload:** Upload a mood board image; the AI will extract the primary "Visual DNA" into 6 hex codes.

### Typography & Text Styles
*   **Narrative Control:** You can now edit the description/purpose for each typeface in the editor to provide better context for design teams.
*   **Live Specimen Wording:** Use the "Live String Buffer" in the Text Styles tab to customize exactly what wording is used to demonstrate your CSS hierarchies.

### Iconography Studio
*   **The Workflow:** 
    1. Enter a theme (e.g., "Medical Nanotech").
    2. AI generates 10 unique vector paths.
    3. Click "Commit" to save them to the brand registry.
*   **Manual Upload:** You can drag-and-drop `.svg` files here. The system will strip the code and store only the raw geometry.

## 3. INTELLIGENCE STUDIO (GEMINI AI)

### Using the "Intelligence Brain"
In the **Brain Studio**, you can provide "Developer Notes." These act as permanent constraints.
*   *Example:* "Never use the word 'cheap'. Always emphasize 'precision'. Use British English spelling."
*   **Effect:** Every piece of copy or image generated for this brand will now follow these specific rules.

## 4. ADVANCED TIPS
*   **Keyboard Shortcut:** Press `Shift + A` on the landing page to quickly access the Admin Login.
*   **Protocol Versions:** Use the **System Vault** to create "Restore Points" before making major AI-driven changes.
*   **Custom Studio Wording:** Any changes you make to Section Titles or Descriptions (Guidelines) in the Detail view or Editor will be preserved by the "Metadata Shield" protocol.
